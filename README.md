📌 Spinal Health: Machine Learning-Based Scoliosis Detection

This project presents an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for detecting scoliosis from spinal X-ray images using MobileNetV2 and transfer learning. The system classifies spines as normal or scoliotic through a lightweight and efficient deep learning architecture, making it suitable for real-time diagnosis on low-resource devices. It includes:

🔍 Data preprocessing (resizing, normalization, manual cleaning)

🔄 Extensive data augmentation to handle class imbalance

🧠 Transfer learning with fine-tuned MobileNetV2

📊 Two-phase training strategy for optimized performance

✅ Achieved 95% test accuracy and strong F1-scores
